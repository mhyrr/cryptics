## 2026-10-16 — dive opened; Step 0; solver built; IDP landscape measured

**Step 0: is it still open?** Yes. Checked: Bourdeau's `targets/blume/NOTES.md` and his commits to 13 Oct; cyphersolver
issues 14 and 37; Fuentes's `sentinel-blume-salamanca` (README of 14 Oct: "unsolved", 0/4 synthetic K2 recoveries);
one web search for a claimed solution after 30 Sept (nothing). Findings:
- Issue 14 (Bean): three letters, I → L, in groups 38, 48 and 122. Bourdeau accepted on 30 Sept, and both hashes now
  agree. Our agent A re-read the archive scans blind and agrees letter for letter (one slip of its own, ANIPS for
  ANLPS, corrected on zoom).
- Issue 37 (Bean, 15 Oct): double transposition unlikely because of repeated strings shared by the two telegrams;
  Bourdeau's 15–25-letter key-phrase claim called an AI hallucination. We measured the first point
  (`analysis/02-shared-repeats`): real at about the 1% level. Agent B found no source for the second.
- Bourdeau's excluded region is wider than the catalog entry said (table in `README.md`). His swap-based IDP local
  search failed on plants at 19 × 23 ("a needle"), and he could not reach the Lasry paper.
- The catalog entry's "no k, w or x" is true of T2 only. T1 has 6 X and 2 K.

**Lasry's method, from the source.** The thesis full text is open via the Kobra DSpace API (bitstream
`kup_9783737604598.pdf`). Read ch. 9.4. Points that matter here: the IDP (best alignment per column pair, greedy
neighbour assignment); K2 hill climbing with segment slides, segment swaps and 3-partite swaps after a left-to-right
pre-pass; K1 solved on n-grams, then K2 refined on the full decryption. Reported success: over 60% at 19 × 20 and 90%
at 18–19 (simulations, 599 letters, English). The challenge itself fell by a fragment ("pernicious") spotted in a
partial solution, then a known-plaintext search, with a K2 dictionary hit as independent confirmation. Its K2
rectangle was nearly complete (599 = 26 × 23 + 1).

**Solver** (`analysis/01-solver`). Corpus: Gutenberg, es 13.6 M / it 8.2 M / pt 6.0 M training letters, with every
5th book held out for control plaintexts. Python reference engine with hand-worked tests; C solver; C decryption
equals Python on 300/300 random cases. IDP checked against an independent Python implementation (equal to 4
decimals). Pilots at 120 s: 15 × 17 recovered in 48 s; 13 × 14 recovered with a one-letter cyclic displacement
(an equivalent key in an incomplete rectangle; accuracy is now measured shift-tolerantly); 18 × 20 and 20 × 21
failed. At 600 s, 16 × 18, 17 × 19, 18 × 20 and 20 × 21 all failed.

**Fitness-distance probe.** At 615 letters the IDP is selective (true K2 −33.35 against climb optima −36.8 to −37.3,
plant 16 × 18) but has almost no gradient beyond three or four swaps. Swaps between columns of equal length, which
move no segment, are barely smoother. So the shift caused by mixing long and short columns is not the main cause.
The margin per link is small: a K1 column of about 38 letters crosses two K2 rows, so each wrong K2 column corrupts
a share of every column pair. This confirms Bourdeau's "needle" with a different implementation and Lasry's own move
set. A probe on the probe was needed first: three parallel probes had shared one temporary file. Fixed.

**Pass rule pre-registered** before the band controls (`analysis/01-solver/README.md`).
